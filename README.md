# Team Agreement
## Team Members: Martha Quintanilla-Ramirez, Vida Powell, Tanesha Brester, Sarah Teklemariam.
### Cooperation Plan
- Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
- Describe at least:
### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  - Vida’s key strength is determination to finish this course! She is also comfortable and curious with mathematical algorithms.
  - Martha’s key strength is communication: what we need to do; as well as determination to complete the course. Martha feels more comfortable with her CSS abilities than other technical proficiencies though inline Bootstrap is challenging.
  - Tanesha’s key strength is spite-driven strength! She is also good with checking in with her team members and is receptive to feedback and open communication. Scheduling flexibility is also a component in her arsenal.
  - Sarah is a great team player and has strong CSS skills as well as time management. Sarah is also open to learning opportunities and challenges.


### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
- Combining the strengths mentioned above we will have the fortitude to face each difficulty, the ability to communicate where we can each best apply our efforts. Our team is uniquely positioned as half on the East coast and half on the West. This will allow us to split complexities between two different pair programming teams for improved daily efficiency.

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Vida, Martha, and Sarah would like to develop greater competency with core JS logic logic algorithms.  Tanesha would also like to develop this same competency but also gain a deeper understanding of overall application construction workflow and implementation.
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

  - Our plan is to openly communicate when we need help and be realistic in planning out our daily tasks. This includes being open to feedback, and holding each other accountable. Async communitcation in slack channel and daily check-ins.

### Confilt Plan

- Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
- Describe at least:
### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  - We plan to exercise open communication and have established our organization is a safe space to avoid conflict. Should something arise anyway, we have Hexx in our slack channel so serve as a mediator and early warning system.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

  - We are all very OK with sharing the load. If someone has a bit more time and is willing to handle a bit more (not to the exclusion of other team member participation) we are patient and comfortable with that. Again we will exercise open and honest communication.

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

  - We will discuss tasks as a group and distribute them according to ability and interest in knowledge expansion.

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - Open communication.

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - If we are not able to resolve the situation internally we will bring in Hexx to mediate.

### Communication Plan

- Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
- Describe at least:

### What hours will you be available to communicate?
	- We have shared hours in slack and on a spreadsheet. Outside of group meetings we will engage in async slack communication to keep everyone up to date.

### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
	- We will all communicate through Slack as our primary form of communication and Remo.

### How often will you take breaks?
  - Every hour and/or as-needed.
### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Regroup and maybe delegate task to see who needs more assistance,
### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - Through slack primarily. All of us have slack download.
### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - Patience and we put Sarah the spot! ;)
### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 
  - At the beginning of each group meeting have a small ice breaker non code related.

### Work Plan
- Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
- NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
  - Describe at least:
### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - Using Trello to keep track of task and check progress on Trello cards, breaking down the project task for each person and each person has a Trellow card to work on.

### What project management tool will be used?
  - Whoever is the one ACPing cannot merge to main, someone else would need to merge the changes being made. Using Trello for task completions.


### Schedule your practice session

- Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
- Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
  - Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
  - When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
  - Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”.

### Git Process
- Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
  - Describe at least:
### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - All components of the project will live on GitHub.
### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - Using GitHub organizations which we have already set up.
### What is your Git flow?


- Will will plan for each team member to create a branch.
  - Prior to each coding session, drivers will git pull from main to their branch
  - After each ACP a different team member will review and merge the commit
  - We all do a git pull from main to branch after merges to main
 
### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
### How many people must review a PR?
  - See above; at least one other person must review a PR.
Who merges PRs?
  - See above: A team member who was NOT responsible for the ACP will review and merge the PR
How often will you merge?
  - As needed.
How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  - With open and honest communication via slack.
